# OCPP-J-CP-Simulator
A really simple Charge Point simulator, that works with OCPP 1.6J.

## Installation
Just clone in a directory accessible from your webserver and point your browser to it.
Go to the setting tab and configure the URL of your OCPP server as well as your Charge Point Id

## Changes:
* Fork and major rewrite from nenecmrf simulator (also borrowing some code from a few other forks)
* Bootstrap based UI;
* Big refactoring (still WIP)
* Status Notification / Send Meter Values now take parameters;
* Ids are now unique for each call
